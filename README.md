## Data sets
To enable scientific reproducibility of our results and other research areas to explore Ethereum, EVM-based rollups, and Inscriptions, we make our pre-processed **data set available for download [here](https://blockchain.mpi-sws.org/datasets/#files%2Finscriptions-boom)** ðŸ“¥.

We believe this data set is key to any research group interested in understanding and providing insights into the Bitcoin ecosystem.
